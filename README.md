# Heartbleed
A simple script which tests if a server is vulnerable to the heartbleed bug. The code is pretty self explanatory. Just pick a target, optionally a port, a mode (either "scan" to test vulnerability or "exfil" to get the data), and the number of bytes to print out.

Obviously this comes with the warning that you shouldn't use this on servers that aren't your own.
